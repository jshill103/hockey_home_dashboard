## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not loading?
```bash
# Check if container is running
docker ps

# View logs
docker logs nhl-dashboard

# Restart container
docker restart nhl-dashboard
```

### Predictions showing 0%?
This is normal before the season starts. Models need game data to train.

### Can't access on port 8080?
```bash
# Use a different port
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e TEAM_CODE=UTA jshillingburg/hockey_home_dashboard:latest

# Then open: http://localhost:3000
```

### Data not persisting?
Make sure you're using volumes:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e TEAM_CODE=UTA \
  -v nhl-data:/app/data \
  jshillingburg/hockey_home_dashboard:latest
```
