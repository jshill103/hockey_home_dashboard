---

## Data Persistence

When you mount the `/app/data` volume, these files are saved:

```
/app/data/
├── accuracy/           # Prediction accuracy history
│   └── accuracy_data.json
├── models/             # Trained model weights
│   ├── elo_ratings.json
│   ├── poisson_rates.json
│   └── neural_network_weights.json
├── results/            # Historical game results
│   ├── processed_games.json
│   └── YYYY-MM.json (monthly archives)
├── matchups/           # Head-to-head matchup history
│   └── matchup_index.json
├── rolling_stats/      # Team form and momentum
│   └── rolling_stats.json
└── player_impact/      # Player talent tracking
    └── player_impact_index.json
```

**Why persist data?**
- Models improve prediction accuracy over time
- Historical tracking of accuracy performance
- Matchup intelligence grows with each game
- No data loss on container restart
