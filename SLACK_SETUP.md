# üèí Utah Mammoth Slack Notifications - Easy Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (2-Minute Setup!)

### Step 1: Get Your Slack Webhook URL

1. **Go to the Slack App**: https://api.slack.com/apps/A09GHT50BFW
2. **Click**: "Incoming Webhooks" in the left sidebar
3. **Toggle**: "Activate Incoming Webhooks" if it's OFF
4. **Click**: "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
5. **Select**: Choose the channel where you want notifications (e.g., #general, #hockey, etc.)
6. **Copy**: The webhook URL that appears (starts with `https://hooks.slack...`)

### Step 2: Add URL to Your Dashboard

**Option A: Edit config.go (Permanent Setup)**
1. Open `config.go` in your project root
2. Find this line:
   ```go
   WebhookURL: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE",
   ```
3. Replace it with your real webhook URL:
   ```go
   WebhookURL: "https://example.com/your-slack-webhook-url-goes-here",
   ```
4. Save the file

**Option B: Environment Variable (Temporary)**
```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://example.com/your-webhook-url"
./web_server -team UTA
```

### Step 3: Start Your Server

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

Edit `config.go` to customize:

	Enabled:    true,  // Set to false to disable notifications
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Slack webhook URL not configured"
- Edit `config.go` and replace the placeholder URL with your real webhook URL

### ‚ùå "No Slack webhook URL provided"
- Make sure you copied the complete webhook URL from Slack
- The URL should start with `https://hooks.slack...`

### ‚ùå "Failed to send Slack message"
- Check that your webhook URL is correct
- Make sure the Slack app has permission to post to your selected channel

### ‚ö†Ô∏è "Slack notifications disabled - no webhook URL configured"
- This means the system detected UTA team but no webhook URL was found
- Follow Step 2 above to configure your webhook URL
