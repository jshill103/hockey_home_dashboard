## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **1. Quality-Weighted Performance**

**Problem:** Beating bad teams looks same as beating good teams  
**Solution:** Weight wins/losses by opponent strength

**Metrics:**
- `QualityOfWins`: Average strength of teams beaten
- `QualityOfLosses`: Average strength of teams lost to
- `VsPlayoffTeamsPct`: Win % vs playoff-caliber teams (>0.6 strength)
- `VsTop10TeamsPct`: Win % vs elite teams (>0.7 strength)
- `ClutchPerformance`: Win % in close games (1-goal)
- `BlowoutWinPct`: % of wins by 3+ goals

**Example:**
```
Team A: 5-2 record
- Beat teams ranked 1, 3, 5, 28, 30 (mixed quality)
- QualityOfWins: 0.68 (high)

Team B: 5-2 record
- Beat teams ranked 20, 22, 25, 27, 29 (all weak)
- QualityOfWins: 0.35 (low)

Team A's wins are more impressive!
```

### **2. Time-Weighted Metrics (Exponential Decay)**

**Problem:** Game from 10 days ago matters same as yesterday  
**Solution:** Apply exponential decay (recent matters more)

**Algorithm:**
```go
weight = 0.85^(games_ago)
// Most recent: weight = 1.0
// 1 game ago:  weight = 0.85
// 2 games ago: weight = 0.72
// 5 games ago: weight = 0.44
// 10 games ago: weight = 0.20
```

**Metrics:**
- `WeightedGoalsFor`: Recent scoring weighted more
- `WeightedGoalsAgainst`: Recent defense weighted more
- `WeightedWinPct`: Recent wins matter more
- `MomentumScore`: -1 (declining) to +1 (improving)
- `FormRating`: 0-10 current form

**Form Rating Formula:**
```
FormRating = 5.0 + 
  (WeightedWinPct * 3.0) +
  (GoalDifferential * 1.0) +
  (MomentumScore * 1.0)
```

**Example:**
```
Team with hot streak:
- Last 3 games: 3-0, 15 goals for, 5 against
- WeightedGoalsFor: 5.2 (high weight on recent)
- FormRating: 8.5/10 (Hot!)

Team cooling off:
- Last 3 games: 0-3, 4 goals for, 12 against
- WeightedGoalsFor: 1.8 (recent struggles)
- FormRating: 2.3/10 (Cold!)
```

---

### **3. Momentum Indicators**

**Problem:** Hard to see if team is improving or declining  
**Solution:** Track points and goal differential over time

**Metrics:**
- `Last3GamesPoints`: Points in last 3 (max 6)
- `Last5GamesPoints`: Points in last 5 (max 10)
- `Last10GamesPoints`: Points in last 10 (max 20)
- `PointsTrendDirection`: "accelerating", "stable", "declining"
- `GoalDifferential3/5/10`: +/- over periods
- `DaysSinceLastWin`: Drought tracking
- `DaysSinceLastLoss`: Dominance tracking

**Trend Detection:**
```
If Last3Points > Last5Points * 0.6: "accelerating"
If Last3Points < Last5Points * 0.4: "declining"
Else: "stable"
```

**Example:**
```
Team on fire:
- Last 3: 6 points (3-0)
- Last 5: 8 points (4-1)
- Last 10: 12 points (6-4)
- Trend: "accelerating" ✅
- GoalDiff3: +8, GoalDiff10: +4
- Getting better!

Team fading:
- Last 3: 1 point (0-2-1)
- Last 5: 6 points (3-2)
- Last 10: 14 points (7-3)
- Trend: "declining" ❌
- GoalDiff3: -6, GoalDiff10: +2
- Recent struggles!
```

---

### **4. Hot/Cold Detection**

**Problem:** Need to identify teams on extreme runs  
**Solution:** Automatic hot/cold flagging

**Detection Logic:**
- `IsHot = true` if 4+ wins in last 5 games
- `IsCold = true` if 4+ losses in last 5 games
- `IsStreaking = true` if 3+ game win/loss streak

**Usage in Predictions:**
```
if team.IsHot {
    boost += 0.05 // +5% for hot teams
}

if opponent.IsCold {
    boost += 0.03 // +3% against cold teams
}
```

---

### **5. Scoring Trends**

**Problem:** Need to see if offense/defense improving  
**Solution:** Compare recent to older performance

**Trend Calculation:**
```
ScoringTrend = (Avg goals last 3) - (Avg goals games 4-8)
// Positive = scoring more lately
// Negative = scoring less lately
```

**Metrics:**
- `ScoringTrend`: Goals/game trend
- `DefensiveTrend`: Goals against trend (reversed)
- `PowerPlayTrend`: PP% trend
- `GoalieTrend`: Save% trend

**Example:**
```
Offensive surge:
- Last 3 games: 4.3 goals/game
- Games 4-8: 2.8 goals/game
- ScoringTrend: +1.5 ✅ (heating up!)

Defensive collapse:
- Last 3 games: 4.0 goals against
- Games 4-8: 2.2 goals against
- DefensiveTrend: -1.8 ❌ (getting worse!)
```

---

### **6. Opponent-Adjusted Metrics**

**Problem:** Playing weak schedule inflates stats  
**Solution:** Adjust for opponent quality

**Opponent Strength Formula:**
```
OpponentStrength = 
  (WinPct * 0.5) +
  (RankComponent * 0.3) +
  (FormRating/10 * 0.2)
```

**Quality Adjustment:**
```
Against strong team (0.7 strength):
  - Goals worth more (qualityFactor = 0.85)
  - AdjustedGoals = ActualGoals / 0.85

Against weak team (0.3 strength):
  - Goals worth less (qualityFactor = 0.65)
  - AdjustedGoals = ActualGoals / 0.65
```

**Metrics:**
- `StrengthOfSchedule`: Average opponent quality (0-1)
- `AdjustedGoalsFor`: Quality-adjusted scoring
- `AdjustedGoalsAgainst`: Quality-adjusted defense
- `AdjustedWinPct`: Opponent-adjusted wins

**Example:**
```
Team A:
- 3.5 goals/game vs weak teams (avg strength 0.4)
- AdjustedGoalsFor: 2.9 (less impressive)

Team B:
- 2.8 goals/game vs strong teams (avg strength 0.7)
- AdjustedGoalsFor: 3.1 (more impressive!)

Team B is actually better offensively!
```

## 📊 **Expected Impact**

### **Accuracy Improvement:**
```
Before Part 2: 85-97%
With Advanced Rolling Stats: 86-98% (+1%)
Total Phase 6 so far: +2% (Matchup + Rolling Stats)
```

### **Why +1%?**

1. **Time-Weighted Metrics**
   - Recent form matters more than old games
   - Catches hot/cold streaks earlier
   - Better represents current team state

2. **Quality-Adjusted Performance**
   - Separates lucky streaks from real strength
   - Identifies paper tigers
   - Values quality wins more

3. **Momentum Detection**
   - Teams on runs tend to continue
   - Catches turning points
   - Identifies fading teams

4. **Opponent-Adjusted Stats**
   - Corrects for schedule strength
   - Prevents over-valuing weak opponent wins
   - More accurate team comparison

## 💡 **Key Algorithms**

### **1. Exponential Decay Weight:**
```go
weight = 0.85^(games_ago)
totalWeight += weight
weightedValue += actualValue * weight
result = weightedValue / totalWeight
```

### **2. Momentum Score:**
```go
recentAvg = (Last 3 games performance) / 3
olderAvg = (Games 4-10 performance) / 7
momentumScore = recentAvg - olderAvg  // -1 to +1
```

### **3. Form Rating:**
```go
formRating = 5.0 + 
  (weightedWinPct * 3.0) +
  (goalDiffComponent * 1.0) +
  (momentumScore * 1.0)
// Clamped to 0-10
```

### **4. Opponent Adjustment:**
```go
qualityFactor = 0.5 + (opponentStrength * 0.5)
adjustedGoals = actualGoals / qualityFactor
```

## 📈 **Integration Points**

### **Needs To Be Added:**

**1. Update PredictionFactors:**
```go
// In models/predictions.go
type PredictionFactors struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // Phase 6 Part 2: Advanced Rolling Stats
    FormRating          float64
    MomentumScore       float64
    IsHot               bool
    IsCold              bool
    WeightedWinPct      float64
    QualityOfWins       float64
    VsPlayoffTeamsPct   float64
    ScoringTrend        float64
    DefensiveTrend      float64
    StrengthOfSchedule  float64
}
```

**2. Call in Rolling Stats Service:**
```go
// In services/rolling_stats_service.go
advancedCalc := NewAdvancedRollingStatsCalculator()

// After updating basic stats
advancedCalc.CalculateAdvancedMetrics(teamStats, allTeamStats)
```

**3. Update Neural Network:**
```go
// Expand to ~110 features (was 65)
features[70] = home.FormRating / 10.0
features[71] = home.MomentumScore
features[72] = boolToFloat(home.IsHot)
features[73] = boolToFloat(home.IsCold)
features[74] = home.WeightedWinPct
features[75] = home.QualityOfWins
features[76] = home.VsPlayoffTeamsPct
features[77] = home.ScoringTrend
features[78] = home.DefensiveTrend
features[79] = home.StrengthOfSchedule
// ... repeat for away team
```
