# 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

## ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### 1. **Main Function Conflict** - FIXED
**Problem**: "main redeclared" compilation error  
**Cause**: Test file `test_scraper_system.go` had a `main()` function in same package as `main.go`  
**Solution**: Moved test file to `tests/` directory to separate packages  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Application now compiles successfully  

### 2. **Scraper ID Case Sensitivity Mismatch** - FIXED  
**Problem**: Fanatics scraper ID mismatch causing "scraper not found" errors  
**Cause**: 
- `fanatics_scraper.go` creates ID: `fanatics_uta` (lowercase)
- `scraper_service.go` looks for: `fanatics_UTA` (uppercase)
**Solution**: Updated scraper service to use `strings.ToLower(ss.teamCode)`  
**Files Modified**:
- `services/scraper_service.go` - Added strings import and lowercase conversion
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Scraper IDs now consistent  

## ⚠️ **CURRENT CHALLENGES**

### 3. **Fanatics Website Access Restriction** - ONGOING
**Problem**: HTTP 403 Forbidden when accessing Fanatics URL  
**Cause**: Fanatics.com has bot detection/protection blocking automated requests  
**Impact**: Cannot scrape products from the specific URL provided  
**Attempted Solutions**:
- Updated User-Agent to Chrome 128.0.0.0
- Added comprehensive browser headers (Sec-Fetch-*, Cache-Control, etc.)
- Used legitimate browser fingerprint
**Current Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Website actively prevents scraping  

### Evidence:
```bash
curl -I "https://www.fanatics.com/nhl/utah-hockey-club/..."
# Returns: HTTP/2 403
```
