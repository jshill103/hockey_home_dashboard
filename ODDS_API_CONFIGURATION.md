# üí∞ Odds API Configuration Guide

## Overview

The NHL Dashboard now supports **The Odds API** for real-time betting market integration. This enhances predictions with live odds, line movements, and market consensus data.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Command-Line Flag Support**
```bash
./web_server -team UTA -odds-key your_api_key_here
```

The new `-odds-key` flag allows you to pass your Odds API key directly via command line, making it easy to test and configure.

### 2. **Environment Variable Support**
```bash
export ODDS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
./web_server -team UTA
```

The application reads `ODDS_API_KEY` from environment variables, perfect for Docker and production deployments.

### 3. **Docker Support**
```bash
# Docker run
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e TEAM_CODE=UTA \
  -e ODDS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
  jshillingburg/hockey_home_dashboard:latest

# Docker Compose
environment:
  - TEAM_CODE=UTA
  - ODDS_API_KEY=your_odds_api_key_here
```

### 4. **Automatic Fallback**
If no API key is provided, the application runs normally with betting market features disabled. All other ML predictions remain fully functional.

---

## üîç Verification

### Check if It's Working

**1. Look for startup message:**
```
üí∞ Odds API key set via command line
‚úÖ Betting Market Service initialized
```

**2. Check logs for API calls:**
```
üìä Fetching betting odds for NHL game...
‚úÖ Received odds from 8 sportsbooks
```

**3. If disabled (no key):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Betting Market Service disabled (no ODDS_API_KEY)
üí° To enable: Get free API key from https://the-odds-api.com/
   Then set: export ODDS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Betting Market Service disabled"
**Solution**: Make sure your API key is set
```bash
# Check if it's set
echo $ODDS_API_KEY

# Set it
export ODDS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Issue: "API rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**: You've used your 500 requests for the month
- Wait until next month (resets on signup date)
- Upgrade to paid tier
- Reduce prediction frequency

### Issue: "Invalid API key"
**Solution**: 
- Check for typos in your key
- Verify key is active in The Odds API dashboard
- Try regenerating your key

### Issue: No betting odds showing
**Possible causes**:
- Game too far in future (odds not posted yet)
- Game already completed
- NHL season not active

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Do:
‚úÖ Use environment variables in production
‚úÖ Keep API keys in `.env` files (not committed to git)
‚úÖ Use Docker secrets for sensitive deployments
‚úÖ Monitor usage in The Odds API dashboard

### Don't:
‚ùå Commit API keys to git
‚ùå Share API keys publicly
‚ùå Hardcode keys in source code
‚ùå Use same key across multiple environments
