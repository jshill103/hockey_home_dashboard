## üéØ **Improvement Categories**

I've organized improvements into 6 strategic categories, ranked by impact:

---

## üìà **CATEGORY 1: Data Enrichment (Highest Impact)**

### **Impact: +5-8% accuracy | Effort: Medium | Priority: HIGH**

The biggest accuracy gains come from better input data.

---

### **1.1 Goalie Intelligence** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Problem:** Currently treat all goalies equally, but starter vs backup is HUGE.

**Solution:** Real-time goalie tracking and performance analysis

**Implementation:**
```
A. Goalie Status Tracking
   - Who's starting tonight? (from NHL API)
   - Recent performance (last 5 starts)
   - Career stats vs opponent
   - Home/Away splits
   - Back-to-back performance

B. Goalie Fatigue Model
   - Games in last 7 days
   - Shots faced recently
   - Quality of competition
   - Recovery time

C. Matchup History
   - Career record vs opponent
   - Goals against average vs this team
   - Save percentage in this building
   - Playoff performance

D. Goalie Momentum
   - Current hot/cold streak
   - Recent shutouts
   - Goals saved above expected (GSAx)
   - High-danger save percentage

Data Sources:
- NHL API: /roster/{team}/current (starting goalie)
- NHL API: /player/{id}/game-log (recent performance)
- Store historical goalie data in data/goalies/
```

**Expected Impact:** +3-5% accuracy
**Rationale:** Goalie is 50% of the game. Starting Vezina winner vs AHL callup is massive.

---

### **1.2 Betting Market Intelligence** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Problem:** Market data service exists but not integrated. "Smart money" is predictive!

**Solution:** Integrate real-time betting odds into predictions

**Implementation:**
```
A. Odds Aggregation
   - Track opening lines
   - Monitor line movement
   - Detect sharp money (big bettors)
   - Compare our predictions to market

B. Market Signals
   - Heavy money on underdog = potential upset
   - Line moving against public = insider info?
   - Sudden odds changes = news (injury, lineup)
   - Opening vs closing line difference

C. Calibration
   - Use market as a baseline
   - Blend our models with market wisdom
   - Disagree when we have edge
   - Agree when market knows better

D. Market-Model Ensemble

   StarPowerDifferential = (HomeStars - AwayStars)
   Add as feature to Neural Network
   Adjust Bayesian priors
   
Data Sources:
- NHL API: /player-stats (real-time)
- NHL API: /roster (who's playing)
- Store top players in data/player_impact/
```

**Expected Impact:** +2-3% accuracy
